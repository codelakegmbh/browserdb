# Contributing
If you want to contribute to the project feel free to open a pull request.
There aren't a lot of requirement regarding the code.
But the following things will be considered when evaluating your pull request:
* Your code is tested
  * You added tests with a fitting number of test cases
  * Your tests result in a coverage of â‰¥90%
* Your code follows the project's [code style](#code-style)

#### code style
If you follow the normal conventions of JavaScript/TypeScript code there is not much you have to watch out for.
So a brief list of this project's code style:
* function, variable, parameter and class property/member names are written in camelCase
* private and protected class property/member names are prefixed with two underscores `__`
* class and decorator names are written in PascalCase
* only one class or decorator per file
* file names are written in lower case there words/abbreviation groups are divided by dashes `-`
* test files end with `.spec.ts`
* don't use default exports

And that's basically all you have to know to start contributing.
This file will also be regularly updated as new guidelines are found.
